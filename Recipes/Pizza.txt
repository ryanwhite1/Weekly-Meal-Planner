Sourdough base recipe	https://youtu.be/OipoWq9VZCI
---------------------
500g plain flour
100g starter discard
10g salt
340g water (dry-ish day)

Mix water and starter together. Add flour and rest for 30 mins. Stretch and fold dough 4 times every 30 minutes. Let rest for an hour, then partition the dough into 4 with a bench scraper. Gently flour each quarter, and shape roughly into a ball. Place the balls in a container for >=4 hours or at least until they double in size. Finally place each ball on a floured surface and lightly rub in flour consistently. Flip and ensure the ball is floured on all sides. Leave for an hour to rest on the surface, then it's ready to use in pizza!
